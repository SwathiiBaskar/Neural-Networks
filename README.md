# Neural Networks – Day 1: Perceptron and Logic Gates

This folder contains a simple implementation of a Perceptron used to simulate basic logic gates like AND, OR, NAND, and NOR.

## Files
- `Perceptron.py` – Custom Perceptron class
- `gates.py` – Logic gate datasets
- `main.py` – Trains and tests the perceptron, plots decision boundaries

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
